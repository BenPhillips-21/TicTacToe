# TicTacToe

Simple Tic Tac Toe project I completed as part of 'The Odin Project'. 

This is a desktop-only game. 

I am completing The Odin Project in order to reinforce the knowledge I learnt over my full stack web development course at Coder Academy. In this project I was able to revise my knowledge of using the DOM, IIFEs, factory functions, the modular pattern and the concepts of scope and closure.
